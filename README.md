Hello wanderer!

My name is Dmitry Baksheev and I work as a software engineer for Huawei.
I also assist teaching [*Programming in C*](https://github.com/Evgueni-Petrov-aka-espetrov/Algorithms-and-Programming-in-C-pptx) at [NSU](https://www.nsu.ru/n/), 
and continue collaboration on simulation of electronic transport phenomena in semiconductor nanostructures.
